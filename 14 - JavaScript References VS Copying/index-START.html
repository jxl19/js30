    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players,team); //2 arrays of the same players
    team[3] = 'Lux'; 
    // however what happens when we update that array?
      //-- this will also change the original players array
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    //only team 2 will have the array changed with lux, original players array will be untouched
    //slice without anything passed in will just return a copy of the array
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    //takes all items out of the iterable and puts it in the containing array
    const team5= Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    //3rd argument lets us update, add values
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    //bc it's only one level deep, the original wes object twitter also changed.
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    //this stringigy's the wes object and then we immediately json.parse it and then we get a full copy it "poor mans deep clone"
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
